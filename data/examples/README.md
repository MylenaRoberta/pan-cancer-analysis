# Examples of Data Artifacts

This folder contains small sample files that illustrate the types of data artifacts generated during pipeline execution.

## Included Files

- `mirna-seq-origin-file.txt`: An example of TCGA origin miRNA-Seq expression data file.
- `mirna-seq-processed-file.txt`: An example of TCGA processed miRNA-Seq expression data file.
- `rna-seq-origin-file.txt`: An example of TCGA origin RNA-Seq expression data file.
- `rna-seq-processed-file.txt`: An example of TCGA processed RNA-Seq expression data file.

## Purpose

These files are for demonstration, testing, and documentation purposes only. The full datasets are too large to include in the repository and are stored elsewhere.
